          <th>Stand Mixer</th>
        
          <td>A stand mixer is used to wisk and mix ingredients together. It is fast and efficient but you want to make sure you don't over mix certain types of batter.  A stand mixer is easy to use and if you have one can be a very useful.</td>  
     
          <td>A stand mixer is not necessay but is very nice to have. Most things can be mixed by hand but may take more time or work. For example when making meringues your egg whites need to be wisked a lot. This task can be done by hand but when using a mixer it is a lot easier and faster. </td>

          <th>Silicon Mat </th>
        
          <td>A silicon mat is a very nice tool to use. it can be used instead of parchment or wax paper for a baking pan. A silicon mat also elimates the use of cooking spray. I use my silicon mat for everything and it is one of my favorite types of baking equiptment. </td>  
     
          <td>I think that a silicon mat is  necessary because it can be used over and over again and is not wasteful. Wax paper can be used instead of a silicon mat but overall a silicon mat is better.</td>
