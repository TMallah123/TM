    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hi! I'm Talia. I Love to bake and when ever I have free time I bake. Growing up I had dairy allergy it was very hard to find baked goods that I was able to eat, So I began baking with my mom and instantly it became one of my favorite things to do. I am now a vegan and so everything I bake is vegan. I love trying new recepies, learning how to make new things and learning about different baking equiptment.</p>
