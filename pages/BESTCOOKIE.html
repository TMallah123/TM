        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
 <p style = " font-size: 10px">NOTE: This is a variation of the chocolate chip cookie recepie on the Food 52 website</p>
    <p>
2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour</p>
<p>1 teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</p>
<p>1 1/4 cups dark chocolate chips (we prefer chocolate with 60 percent cocoa content or higherâ€”double-check the ingredients if you want to make sure they're vegan)</p>
<p>1/2 cup (100 grams) sugar</p>
<p>1/2 cup (110 grams) packed light or dark brown sugar </p>
<p>1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon canola, grapeseed, or any other neutral oil</p>
<p>1/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon water</p>
<p>Coarse-grained sea salt or flaky sea salt like Maldon, for garnish</p>
    
<p> 		In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Add the chocolate chips to the flour mixture and toss to coat.</p>
        
<p> In a separate large bowl, whisk the sugars briskly with the canola oil and water until smooth and incorporated, about 2 minutes. Note: Use fresh, soft light brown sugar. If there are clumps, break them up with the back of a spoon or your hand before whisking.</p>
<p> Add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, and then stir with a wooden spoon or a rubber spatula until just combined and no flour is visible. Do not overmix.
<p> Cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 12 hours and up to 24 hours. Do not skip this step.</p>
<p>  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two rimmed sheet pans with parchment paper. Remove dough from the refrigerator and use an ice cream scoop or a spoon to portion dough into 2-inch mounds. We recommend freezing the balls of dough for 10 minutes before baking as the cookies will retain their shape better while baking.</p> 
<p> Sprinkle the balls of dough with coarse-grained sea salt (if freezing, remove balls of dough from the freezer first), and bake for 12 to 13 minutes, or until the edges are just golden.</p> 
<p> Do not overbake.</p> 
<p> Cool before eating </p>
